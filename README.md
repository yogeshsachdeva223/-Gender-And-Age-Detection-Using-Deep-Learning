# Gender-And-Age-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Dataset: UTK Face

Gender and Age Detection Python Project- Objective
To build a gender and age detector that can approximately guess the gender and age of the person (face) in a picture using Deep Learning on the dataset.

Gender and Age Detection – About the Project
In this Python Project, we will use Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face.The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age. It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. And so, we make this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.

Steps:

Detect faces
Classify into Male/Female
Classify into one of the 8 age ranges
Put the results on the image and display it
